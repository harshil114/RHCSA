- This is data from file1.
- When we have to create hardlink then first create a file of what you want to create a hardlink.
- hardlink points to the same data of original file.
- We will make hardlink of this file. For that command is:
	ln <source_file> <hard_link_name>
- To verify ls -il, followed with both files name is used.
- If original file is deleted the hard link remains.
