Create a hard link to the ~/Documents/project_plans/season2_project_plan.odf
file called ~/Documents/backups/season2_project_plan.odf.back. A hard link
protects against accidental deletion of the original file and keeps the backup file updated as
you change the original file. Hint: If the ~/Documents/backups directory does not exist,
then use the mkdir command to create it.



harshil@vbox:~/Documents/RHCSA/homework/ch2/lab_practice$ cd ..
harshil@vbox:~/Documents/RHCSA/homework/ch2$ mkdir backups
harshil@vbox:~/Documents/RHCSA/homework/ch2$ cd backups/

harshil@vbox:~/Documents/RHCSA/homework/ch2/lab_practice$ ln ~/Documents/RHCSA/homework/ch2/lab_practice/project_plans/season2_project_plan.odf ~/Documents/RHCSA/homework/ch2/backups/season2_project_plan.odf.back
