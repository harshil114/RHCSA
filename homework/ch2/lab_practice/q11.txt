After further review, you decide that you do not need the plot changes. Delete the changes
directory.
If it is necessary, then navigate to the changes directory and delete all the files within the
directory. You cannot delete a directory while it is the current working directory.
Change to the parent directory of the changes directory. Try to delete the empty directory
by using the rm command without the -r recursive option. This attempt should fail. Finally,
use the rmdir command to delete the empty directory, which succeeds.
When the vacation is over, you no longer need the vacation directory. Delete it by using the
rm command with the recursive option.
When finished, return to the student user's home directory.
